**Earthquake Analysis Project**

This project aims to analyze earthquake data obtained through the United States Geological Survey (USGS) API using Python. The analysis explores various aspects of earthquake occurrences such as frequency, magnitude, and distribution, with the goal of gaining insights into seismic event patterns and correlations with natural phenomena.

**Project Components**

**Data Collection:** Utilized the USGS API to retrieve real-time and historical earthquake data, including information about location, magnitude, and depth of each earthquake.
Data Analysis and Pre-processing: Leveraged Python libraries such as pandas and json for data manipulation and preprocessing. Explored earthquake frequency, magnitude, and distribution trends through visualization techniques.

**Visualization:** Generated visualizations including maps and plots to illustrate earthquake data distribution and trends.
Insights and Conclusions: Derived insights from the analysis to aid in understanding and mitigating the impact of earthquakes on a global scale.
Usage

**Data Collection:** Execute the read_data_from_url() function with the desired USGS API URL to retrieve earthquake data.
